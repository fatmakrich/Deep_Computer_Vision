# Intel Image Classification

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify images in the Intel Image Classification Dataset.

The dataset contains images categorized into six classes representing different natural scenes: 

buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street.

# Project Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

- To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch without relying on pre-trained models.
- To gain a deeper understanding of how CNNs work, including key layers like convolutions, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- To train and evaluate the model on the Intel Image Classification dataset to achieve meaningful results.

# Dataset

 The Intel Image Classification Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle :

- Classes: Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, and Street
- Structure: Images are organized into folders for training, validation, and testing.
- Size: Approximately 25,000 images.
